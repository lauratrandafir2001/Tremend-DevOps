#Task1
- I had Docker and Docker desktop installed
- I used this command to pull an ubuntu image
docker pull ubuntu:latest
- I used this command to run the ubuntu image
docker run -it --name my_linux_container ubuntu:latest
-I added a new user with
useradd -m john
- I copied the file from github to my container
- I created the script step by step, running it each time to make sure it works
- I corrected a small typo in the create_large_file.sh script that I corrected, "mv lage_file", otherwise the script
would not work
