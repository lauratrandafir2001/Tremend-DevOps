#Setup for task3
-copy the file company.sql in the root of the project
- create a docker container with the following command
docker run --name mysql-companyy -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql:latest
- create a database with the following command and import sql dump
docker exec -i mysql-companyy mysql -uroot -ppassword company < company.sql
- This command threw an error, so I tried with this instead, to be able to execute a MySQL client session in the container:
docker exec -it mysql-companyy mysql -uroot -ppassword
- I noticed that the company database was not created, so I created it with 
CREATE DATABASE company;
- I imported the sql dump with the following command:
docker exec -i mysql-companyy mysql -uroot -ppassword -h localhost -P 3306 company < company.sql
- This threw the error : "ERROR 1366 (HY000) at line 12: Incorrect integer value: 'Consulting' for column 'department' at row 41"
- I fixed the error by changing the value of the department column from 'Consulting'

- I created a new user with the following command:
docker exec -i mysql-companyy mysql -uroot -ppassword -e "CREATE USER 'company_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';"
- I granted all privileges to the user with the following command:
docker exec -i mysql-companyy mysql -uroot -ppassword -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON company.* TO 'company_user'@'%';"
docker exec -i mysql-companyy mysql -uroot -ppassword -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
-Find average salary for each department
- I tried connecting to the database first with:
docker exec -it mysql-companyy mysql -uroot -ppassword
- I specified the database that I want to use
USE company;
- I ran the following query to find the average salary for each department:
SELECT d.department_name, AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.department_id GROUP BY e.department;
 - To mount volumes I used 
  docker run --name mysql-ccompany -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql:latest
