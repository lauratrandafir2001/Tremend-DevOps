#TASK3
- FIrst, I chose to use app.py
- I created the Dockerfile
- I tested the Dockerfile locally using:
docker build -t simpleapp .
docker run simpleapp 
which returned the output: "Hello, World!"
- I created a repository on DockerHub
- I pushed and pull the image to test, using 
docker login
docker push lauraflorina200178/tremend:latest
docker pull lauraflorina200178/tremend:latest
- I went to Secrets section on GIthub, and add DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD
 with my Docker Hub login credentials.
- I created a new branch and a new file, docker-build-and-push.yaml where I specified the restrictions
- I created a new workflow, using the template from the documentation
- I pushed the changes to the new branch
- The workflow build was ok, but the push failed, because I had an incorrect tagg
- I corrected myself the push was successful
